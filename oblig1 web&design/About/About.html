    <li>When preparing what kind of semantics I would use for the Homepage,
     I looked at what needed to be most visible. What do I want the user
        to catch on. I used semantics such as Article for the main content,
     and all of the content are in figures to give the user a better
     understanding of the content. To emphasize that the quote from 
        Hotel California is a quote I used the "blockquote" tag so that 
     even machines can read it.  All of the pictures use has 
        an "alt" tag to describe what the picture consists of, and 
        since some of the pictures have an amusing undertone, I 
        tried to match that with the description.  Most of 
        my semantic use is based on the principles that you should be able to 
        enjoy the website, even if your own eyes canÂ´t see it. 
     Therefor I see the Homepage code as universally accessable, based on my use of HTML elements.
